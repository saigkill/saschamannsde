# MannsBlog

I re-wrote my blog using a new stack of web technologies including:

 - ASP.NET Core 3.1
 - Entity Framework Core 3.1
 - Vue 2.x
 - Bootstrap 4 
 - Azure Websites (Docker) and Azure Blob Storage
 
The project wasn't build to be a blog engine or a easy to re-use for your own blog. It doesn't mean you can't use it for that. Feel free to fork the project, but that wasn't a design goal. 

The current project is built with many pre-release technologies so that the code-base will change a lot as these technologies get closer to release. 

This project bases on Shawn Wildermuths WilderBlog.

See his blog entry (and the live site) for more information on how and why he built it:
